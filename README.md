# hello-world
Ahhh, my first GitHub repository.  I should have done this a long time ago.

Hey, I'm Dave Fairchild.  I work as a Senior Application Developer specializing in working with OSIsoft's PI System.

I currently work in the utilities industry.  I have worked with OSIsoft's products over 15 years in the Pulp and Paper industry, the Oil and Gas industry and the Chemcal industry and, of course, in the utilities industry.
